    bio: ['I\'ve known I\'ve wanted to become a massage therapist since I was in middle school. I\'m originally from Canada, but grew up here in Renton, and when choosing a massage school I knew RTC would be the best fit for me. RTC was local, affordable, and had an amazing program. In massage school I created a 5 year goal of owning my own business.','I graduated in 2014 and I\'ve worked off and on since then. In 2016 my stepmom was diagnosed with breast cancer and it was at that time I knew I wanted to get certified in breast massage. In 2017, I took a 3 year maternity leave due to high risk pregnancies. In 2022, I officially opened up ARC Massage. I feel like due to my 3 year gap, I still completed my 5 year plan. My specialties are shoulders, glutes, prenatal/postantal, breast/chest, and therapeutic massage.'],

    bio: ['My initial interest in massage started as caring for family members/friends toward the end of their life with a simple back rub to ease their anxiety but as I progress into my career helping anyone with aches and pains feel better in their body is my goal overall. I love a good treatment massage but glad to provide relaxation as well.','I have a mixed style of table thai, lomi lomi & deep tissue. I also always recommend a spot treatment of cupping! I am a mom of two. Graduate of Cortiva Institute 2014 and native Seattlite!'],

    bio: ['I suffered poor skin when I was growing up and even as an adult, which made me want to pursue esthetics. I wanted to learn how to heal myself but to also empower and help others. Your skin is a great indicator of your health and it is an important part of the body that often is over looked.',
    'I studied at the Euro institute and practiced holistic skin care. I am currently studying to get my masters and constantly trying to continue my education in this growing field. I am oncology certified, I hold a certificate from the NCEA (national coalition of estheticians association). I have been trained in facial MLD, and much more.', 
    
    'My goal as an esthetician is to help teach others how to care for their skin and help address the problems they are facing in a manageable way. It always feels wonderful to serve and make others feel good. ❤️'],
